              Founded in 2012, The Entrepreneurship Hatchery provides a
              comprehensive suite of programs and services designed to help
              students with entrepreneurial ambitions form teams, develop new
              competencies and launch their companies. Over the last five years,
              The Hatchery has helped to launch over 94 new startups, which
              collectively have raised close to $64 million in seed funding.
              Students start by attending events throughout the school year â€”
              the Hatchery offers Idea Markets, Speaker Series, Coffee Days,
              Cofounders Day, Hatchery Circle, Accelerator Weekend - events that
              nurture a strong culture of entrepreneurship on campus. From
              there, teams apply to one of the Hatcheryn&apos;s four processes:{" "}
              <b>Hatchery NEST</b>, designed for all current U of T students,{" "}
              <b>Hatchery LaunchLab</b>, which caters to graduate-level research
              driven startups looking to commercialize their discoveries,{" "}
              <b>Hatchery Social</b>, which enables social impact startups such
              as non-for-profit and social critical challenges, and the{" "}
              <b>Start@UTIAS+Hatchery</b>, which is a process designed for UTIAS
              students or recent graduates with the goal of feeding into either
              the NEST or LaunchLab stream.

            Hatchery NEST is an intensive four-month program running from May to
            August each year. Teams are matched with advisory boards including
            dedicated mentors, and have access to resources such as professional
            services, including lawyers to help secure intellectual property
            protection, and marketing experts to help refine branding.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            Through bi-weekly pitch sessions, the teams also receive detailed
            feedback on how to hone their message and build the confidence that
            will enable them to attract their first investors. The process
            culminates in Demo Day, held early each September, where the
            remaining teams compete for a share of more than $40,000 in seed
            funding.

              Demo Day is the culmination of The Hatchery NEST, a four-month

              including executives, lawyers, entrepreneurs etc. -- to develop
              their businesses. They receive detailed feedback on their business
              plans, explore their proposed market, learn about patents and
              marketing, and build prototypes using 3D printers and other
              fabrication resources.
